		<h2>WHO IS jayarempty?</h2>
			<blockquote>

		<h2>FAVORITE SUBJECTS</h2>
			<blockquote>
				My favorite <strong>CMSC subjects</strong> are <strong>CMSC 12</strong> and <strong>CMSC 21</strong> because the <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C</strong> languages were not very hard for me to learn (compared to <i>Java</i> where I really <strong>STRUGGGLED</strong>). Also, I do not have a favorite GE subject because <i>I hate all of them the same</i>.
			</blockquote>

				<strong>HAWAIIAN PIZZA</strong> IS THE ONLY CORRECT ANSWER!

		<h2>HOBBIES</h2>
			<blockquote>
				My hobbies include listening to music (mostly <strong>Korean songs</strong>) and watching <strong>Mobile Legends streams</strong> in YouTube. Sometimes, I read some <strong>books</strong>, but I easily get bored by reading unless the material is very interesting.
			</blockquote>
		<h2>MY CHILDHOOD DREAM</h2>
			<blockquote>
				I do not remember what I want when I was a child, but I guess one of them is to be a <strong>superhero</strong>. Looking back at it, it is somehow <i>lame</i> because my concept of superheroes revolves around people with <strong>supernatural powers</strong>. Additionally, I think I want to be a superhero back then because <strong>I hate policemen</strong> (they were always <i>late</i> at the crime scene).
